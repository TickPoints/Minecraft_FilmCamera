# Preliminary Use
Thank you for using our FilmCamera for your convenience.

 The `camera` command is a great tool to help us make all kinds of beautiful visual effects, but unfortunately there are no better graphical tools (or modules) to help us use it. Anyone who has used it will know that it is extremely troublesome to modify the coordinates and control functions in the command box. So we created this tool.
# Create World
Next, create a new world (you can also use the existing world, but remember to complete the necessary operations), and then follow these steps:

1. Change the mode to **Create** for the next operation
2. Enable cheats and command boxes (required)
3. Go to *ExperimentalOptions* and enable the **Beta APIs** (required)
4. Enable **Creator Cameras** (provides more convenient lens effects), **Creator Cameras** and **Aim Assist** (facilitates special lenses for aiming entities)
5. It is best to have all **ADD-ON CRERTORS** enabled, as future features and other Addon may be used

# Simple Command System
First we provide a command system to help you better operate, and we will briefly introduce it in the following (if you need more introduction, read [this](./CommandSystem/index.md)). Here we only introduce some common commands. First we enter on the console:

> !

This is the basis for triggering the command system. After a carriage return, the message you issue is not displayed, but executed as a command. Before that, you have to get permission first. Execute under op authority:

> /tag @s add camera_editor

Now enter at the console:

> !runMinecraftCommand (&say Hello, FilmCamera!)

This will execute the Minecraft command as you `say Hello, FilmCamera!`. After execution, you can see the message.
